## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Investor Due Diligence

**Context:** Potential investor reviewing the business

**Dashboard 1 Shows:**
- $39K revenue (baseline)
- 88.72% volatility (major risk)
- 48% customer concentration (deal-breaker?)
- High AOV ($1,158) suggests quality

**Investor Questions:**
- "Why did February drop 88.72%?" → Investigate before funding
- "What if Hank leaves?" → 24% revenue loss
- "Can this scale?" → Retention must be fixed first

**Decision Impact:** These dashboards could lower valuation or require retention fix before investment

---

### Scenario 2: Marketing Budget Allocation

**Context:** CMO deciding between acquisition vs. retention spend

**Dashboard 2 Shows:**
- 62% one-time buyers (retention problem)
- 12 customers churning (immediate opportunity)
- Converting 30% of Bronze = $7K+ revenue

**Decision:**
- Shift 40% of budget from acquisition to retention
- Expected ROI: Higher (existing relationships vs. cold prospects)
- Test: Bronze conversion campaign before scaling

---

### Scenario 3: Customer Success Resource Planning

**Context:** Deciding whether to hire customer success manager

**Dashboard 2 Shows:**
- 2 Platinum customers = 46% of revenue
- Current attention: None (no CS team)
- Risk: One cancellation = catastrophic

**Business Case:**
- CS Manager cost: $60K/year
- Protecting $18K in Platinum revenue: Break-even if prevents one churn
- Growing 3 Gold to Platinum: $9K additional revenue

**Decision:** Hire immediately - ROI is clear

---

### Scenario 4: Product Roadmap Prioritization

**Context:** Product team has 5 features to build, capacity for 2

**Dashboard 2 Insights:**
- 62% never return after first order
- No loyalty program exists
- High-value customers have multiple orders

**Decision:**
- Build Feature 1: Loyalty program (addresses 62% problem)
- Build Feature 2: Order history/reordering (encourages repeats)
- Delay Features 3-5 (acquisition features less critical)
